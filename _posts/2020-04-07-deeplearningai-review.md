A short review of [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?](Deeplearning.ai's Deep Learning Specialization) on Coursera.

# Review of Deeplearning.ai's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
- no discussion of ethics
- little mention on importance of data science (EDA)
- Structuring ML Projects: creating dev set is data science!
- volume of videos changes a lot
- Lot of repetition, could use a bit more explicit examples/procedures, see eg end of "Multi-task learning" video
- Could give more references at end of lectures for further reading
- Balanced batching over categories during training should be considered in mismatched train/dev/test lectures
- hardly any mention of cross validation
- talking about "image" when talking about activations after convolutions, instead of representations
- why does "larger" weights mean more has been learned or that weight is more important for a decision? Isn't it about relative sizes, ie, how much more important is some feature over the other?
- translational equivariance for convolutions, not translational invariance

My quick notes for the five courses:
1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](2020-04-07-deeplearningai-nns-and-dl.md)
2. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](2020-04-07-deeplearningai-structuring-ml-projects.md)
3. [Improving Deep Neural Networks](2020-04-07-deeplearningai-improving-dnn.md)
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](2020-04-07-deeplearningai-convnets.md)
5. [Sequence Models](2020-04-07-deeplearningai-sequence.md)
